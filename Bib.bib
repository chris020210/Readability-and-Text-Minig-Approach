We establish these insights within a class of games which nests, but is not limited to, the New Keynesian model. Our results help resolve the forward-guidance puzzle, offer a rationale for the front-loading of fiscal stimuli, and illustrate more broadly the fragility of predictions that rest on long series of forward-looking feedback loops.},

Unlike those authors, we treat the break date as unknown a priori. Asymptotic distributions are developed for recursive, rolling, and sequential tests for unit roots and/or changing coefficients in time series regressions. The recursive and rolling tests are based on changing subsamples of the data. The sequential statistics are computed using the full data set and a sequence of regressors indexed by a ``break'' date. When applied to data on real postwar output from seven Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, these techniques fail to reject the unit-root hypothesis for five countries (including the United States) but suggest stationarity around a shifted trend for Japan.},

Szigriszt made an adaptation of the RES Flesch Score, calling it Escala de Nivel de Perspicuidad (Clarity Level Scale), to measure the difficulty in reading a text. But Szigriszt used a text sample that was neither representative nor random, which is why the conclusions are not sufficiently consistent. The aim of this article is to complete the process begun by Szigriszt, review the Szigriszt Scale, comparing it with Fleschs scale, and propose a scale according to Spanish reading habits. Methods. Descriptive study. Two hundred and ten documents of 3 types were selected at random: Stationary magazines, school textbooks and scientific magazines. Three fragments of at least 500 words were chosen at random from each one, from the beginning, middle and end. The Flesch-Szigriszt Index (\'Indice de Legibilidad de Flesch-Szigriszt [IFSZ]), available on the INFLESZ program, was calculated. The scores were classified according to the Flesch and Szigriszt scales. Results. The readability of the stationary magazines is 60, of scientific magazines 37.9, and school textbooks 67.39. Conclusions. Only the scientific magazines are situated between 0 and 50. There are no publications with scores lower than 15. Szigrsizt locates Normal from 50; Flesch from 60. An intermediate position is adopted and a new scale is proposed: the INFLESZ Scale, which establishes 5 sections: Very difficult ({$<$}80), Somewhat difficult (40-55), Normal (55-65), Quite easy (65-80) and Very easy ({$>$}80). Neither the Clarity Level Scale of Szigriszt nor the RES Flesch Score are adapted to Spanish reading habits. In the case of texts on health, there is a greater probability of their being read and understood if they exceed 55. Key words. Readability. Health Education. Health measurement tools.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve deployed an extraordinary range of policy tools that helped prevent the collapse of the financial system and the U.S. economy. Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues lent directly to U.S. businesses, purchased trillions of dollars of government securities, pumped dollars into the international financial system, and crafted a new framework for monetary policy that emphasized job creation. These strategies would have astonished Powell's late-20th-century predecessors, from William McChesney Martin to Alan Greenspan, and the advent of these tools raises new questions about the future landscape of economic policy. In 21st Century Monetary Policy, Ben S. Bernanke\textemdash former chair of the Federal Reserve and one of the world's leading economists\textemdash explains the Fed's evolution and speculates on its future. Taking a fresh look at the bank's policymaking over the past seventy years, including his own time as chair, Bernanke shows how changes in the economy have driven the Fed's innovations. He also lays out new challenges confronting the Fed, including the return of inflation, cryptocurrencies, increased risks of financial instability, and threats to its independence. Beyond explaining the central bank's new policymaking tools, Bernanke also captures the drama of moments when so much hung on the Fed's decisions, as well as the personalities and philosophies of those who led the institution.},

We find that the resulting limited ability to manage expectations reduces but does not eliminate the advantages of L4L policies.

This lecture reviews what we know about the new monetary tools, focusing on quantitative easing (QE)  and forward guidance, the principal new tools used by the Fed. I argue that the new tools have proven effective at easing financial conditions when policy rates are  constrained by the lower bound, even when financial markets are functioning normally, and that they can be made even more effective in the future. Accordingly, the new  tools should become part of the standard central bank toolkit. Simulations of the Fed's FRB/US model suggest that, if the nominal neutral interest rate is in the range of 2\textendash 3 percent, consistent with most estimates for the United States, then a combination of QE and forward guidance can provide the equivalent of roughly 3 percentage  points of policy space, largely offsetting the effects of the lower bound. If the neutral rate is much lower, however, then overcoming the effects of the lower bound may  require additional measures, such as a moderate increase in the inflation target or greater reliance on fiscal policy for economic stabilization.},

We also find that the additional information on risk to inflation and especially projection risk assessment contained in the ECB's Monthly Bulletins helps to improve communication clarity compared to ECB's press releases. In contrast, the bulletin's communication on monetary developments has a negative, albeit small, impact on clarity.},

We examine how public statements of FOMC intentions\textemdash forward guidance\textemdash can substitute for lower rates at the zero bound. We distinguish between Odyssean forward guidance, which publicly commits the FOMC to a future action, and Delphic forward guidance, which merely forecasts macroeconomic performance and likely monetary policy actions. Others have shown how forward guidance that commits the central bank to keeping rates at zero for longer than conditions would otherwise warrant can provide monetary easing, if the public trusts it. We empirically characterize the responses of asset prices and private macroeconomic forecasts to FOMC forward guidance, both before and since the recent financial crisis. Our results show that the FOMC has extensive experience successfully telegraphing its intended adjustments to evolving conditions, so communication difficulties do not present an insurmountable barrier to Odyssean forward guidance. Using an estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, we investigate how pairing such guidance with bright-line rules for launching rate increases can mitigate risks to the Federal Reserve's price stability mandate.},

  abstract = {The global financial crisis hit hard in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Real GDP from peak to trough contracted by about 6 percent in the euro area and the United Kingdom and by  9 percent in Japan. In all three cases, central banks cut interest rates aggressively and then, as policy rates approached zero, deployed a variety of untested and unconventional monetary policies.  In doing so, they hoped to restore the functioning of financial markets, and also to provide further monetary policy accommodation once the policy rate reached the zero lower bound. In all  three jurisdictions, the strategy entailed generous liquidity support for banks and other financial intermediaries and large-scale purchases of public (and in some cases private) assets. As a result,  central banks' balance sheets expanded to unprecedented levels. This paper examines the experience with unconventional monetary policies in the euro zone, the United Kingdom, and Japan.  The paper starts with a discussion of how quantitative easing, forward guidance, and negative interest rate policies work in theory, and some of their potential side effects. It then reviews the  implementation of unconventional monetary policy by the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan, including a narrative of how central banks responded to the crisis  and the evidence on the effects of unconventional monetary policy actions.},

Full transparency of the central bank's intentions is generally socially beneficial but frequently worse for the bank. Somewhat paradoxically, direct observability of idiosyncratic central bank goals removes the moderating influence on the bank and leads to the worst equilibrium.}

The speech considers three features of the 1990s that have driven this convergence. First, the increasing adoption of inflation targeting throughout the world as a framework for monetary policy. Second, the increased attention paid to promoting the transparency of policy. And third, the new interest in monetary policy in an environment of low inflation.

We then present and discuss in detail the reasons for the FOMC's adoption of the reform and the communications challenge presented to the Committee during this period. Further, we examine whether the essential characteristics of the reform were consistent with monetarism, new, neo, or old-fashioned Keynesianism, nominal income targeting, and inflation targeting. The record suggests that the reform was adopted when the FOMC became convinced that its earlier gradualist strategy using finely tuned interest rate moves had proved inadequate for fighting inflation and reversing inflation expectations. The new plan had to break dramatically with established practice, allow for the possibility of substantial increases in short-term interest rates, yet be politically acceptable, and convince financial markets participants that it would be effective. The new operating procedures were also adopted for the pragmatic reason that they would likely succeed.},

This transition led to an increase of electricity production from renewable sources and thereby affected the whole electricity market. Therefore, it provides lessons for countries, which are only beginning a similar transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The aim of this analysis is to assess if there still exists a relationship between fossil fuel and electricity prices. Due to possible structural breaks in the time series a minimum Lagrange Multiplier (LM) stationarity test is applied, which endogenously determines possible structural breaks. Subsequently a bootstrap approach is used to estimate confidence intervals (C.I.s) for the test statistic and the possible break dates. Furthermore, the stability of the cointegration vector is assessed with the test by Hansen and Johansen (}

Using long historical time series for the U.S. we are unable to reject the hypothesis that these series are non-stationary stochastic processes with no tendency to return to a trend line. Based on these findings and an unobserved components model for output that decomposes fluctuations into a secular or growth component and a cyclical component we infer that shocks to the former, which we associate with real disturbances, contribute substantially to the variation in observed output. We conclude that macroeconomic models that focus on monetary disturbances as a source of purely transitory fluctuations may never be successful in explaining a large fraction of output variation and that stochastic variation due to real factors is an essential element of any model of macroeconomic fluctuations.},

The interest is that we allow under both the null and alternative hypotheses for the presence of a one-time change in the level or in the slope of the trend function. We show how standard tests of the unit root hypothesis against trend stationary alternatives cannot reject the unit root hypothesis if the true data generating mechanism is that of stationary fluctuations around a trend function which contains a one-time break. This holds even asymptotically. We derive test statistics which allow us to distinguish the two hypotheses when a break is present. Their limiting distribution is established and selected percentage points are tabulated. We apply these tests to the Nelson-Plosser data set and to the postwar quarterly real GNP series. In the former, the break is due to the 1929 crash and takes the form of a sudden change in the level of the series. For 11 out of the 14 series analyzed by Nelson and Plosser we can reject at a high confidence level the unit root hypothesis. In the case of the postwar quarterly real GNP series, the break in the trend function occurs at the time of the oil price shock (1973) and takes the form of a change in the slope. Here again we can reject the null hypothesis of a unit root. If one is ready to postulate that the 1929 crash and the slowdown in growth after 1973 are not realizations of an underlying time-invariant stochastic process but can be modeled as exogenous, then the conclusion is that most macroeconomic time series are not characterized by the presence of a unit root. Fluctuations are indeed stationary around a deterministic trend function. The only "shocks" which have had persistent effects are the 1929 crash and the 1973 oil price shock.},

Our approach is nonparametric with respect to nuisance parameters and thereby allows for a very wide class of weakly dependent and possibly heterogeneously distributed data. The tests accommodate models with a fitted drift and a time trend so that they may be used to discriminate between unit root nonstationarity and stationarity about a deterministic trend. The limiting distributions of the statistics are obtained under both the unit root null and a sequence of local alternatives. The latter noncentral distribution theory yields local asymptotic power functions for the tests and facilitates comparisons with alternative procedures due to Dickey \& Fuller. Simulations are reported on the performance of the new tests in finite samples.},

It first considers the consequences of improved information about central-bank actions, and argues that the management of expectations will become even more important to effective monetary policy. The paper next considers the consequences of the potential erosion of private-sector demand for central-bank money. This should not fundamentally impair the ability of central banks to achieve their stabilization objectives, though it may require a new approach to the implementation of monetary policy. The advantages of a 'channel' system, in which central-bank standing facilities are the main tool used to control overnight interest rates, are discussed.},
